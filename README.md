## Usage

### Upstream Embedding Learning:

#### Step1	

Change the model training hyperparameters in the [FedE/main.py](https://github.com/DocAILab/FedE4RAG/blob/main/FedE/main.py).

#### Step2

Select the appropriate training data and copy it to the [FedE/select_data.json](https://github.com/DocAILab/FedE4RAG/blob/main/FedE/select_data.json).

#### Step3

Generate the fine-tuned model by executing the following shell script. (Before running, change the "data_path" augument in the script and code as needed)

```
