As\na percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal\n2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and\nfavorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower\nmerchandise margin.\nSG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal\n2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to\n23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of\nincentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate\noverhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits\ndue to wage investments."
