MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n"

                    "evidence_text_full_page": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an\naudit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\ntax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductionsnet.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2.

In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3\nbillion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing\nagreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in developmentindefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technologyfinite-lived licensing agreements\nwith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of\napproximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market\nparticipant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nTherachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for\nthe treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470\nmillion contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset.

In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\nfinancing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operationsnet of\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\nbanking fees.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n65\n"

This reflects the non-additive nature \nof VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as \nthe maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.\n(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions \nrevenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's \ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening \nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now \nreflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and related hedges.\n(e) For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated \nvolatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first quarter of 2022.\nQuarter over quarter results\nAverage total VaR was flat for the three months ended \nJune 30, 2023, when compared with March 31, 2023, \nreflecting increases in fixed income offset by market volatility \nrelating to commodities rolling out of the one-year historical \nlook-back period. \nYear over year results\nAverage total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three \nmonths ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same \nperiod in the prior year predominantly driven by risk \nreductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR as well as fixed \nincome.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\n$ millions\n0\n50\n100\nSecond Quarter\n2022\nThird Quarter\n2022\nFourth Quarter\n2022\nFirst Quarter\n2023\nSecond Quarter\n2023\n85\n"

Although such transactions are excluded \nfrom the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these \ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating \ndecision makers assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information \nregarding Corporate and other results. \nCapital Expenditures and Investments \nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the \ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizons \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network \nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\nefficient manner. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment \nresults. In \"Segment Results of Operations,\" we review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail.

Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service \nperiod of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets \nassumption to the actual fair value of plan assets.

Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in \nearnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along \nwith the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is \nreported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net \ninvestment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other \ncomprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on \nthe value of our net investment. \nCash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the \ncash flow classification of the related hedged items.

This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result,\nwe report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K).\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the\nyear, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\nDecember 25,\n2021\n(In millions)\nNet revenue:\nData Center\n$\n6,043 \n$\n3,694 \nClient\n6,201 \n6,887 \nGaming\n6,805 \n5,607 \nEmbedded\n4,552 \n246 \nTotal net revenue\n$\n23,601 \n$\n16,434 \nOperating income (loss):\nData Center\n$\n1,848 \n$\n991 \nClient\n1,190 \n2,088 \nGaming\n953 \n934 \nEmbedded\n2,252 \n44 \nAll Other\n(4,979)\n(409)\nTotal operating income (loss)\n$\n1,264 \n$\n3,648 \nData Center\nData Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021.

The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily\ndriven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.\nClient operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021.
