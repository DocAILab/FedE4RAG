During 2021, we entered into (i) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice\nthat resolved the Department of Justices previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) as well as (ii) a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that resulted in the Company\nreceiving $219 in the second quarter of 2022. In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and\nExchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was\npaid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of\nany remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and\nservices operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to\npromote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based\non Embraers failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is\ncurrently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration, which we currently expect to\nbe completed in late 2023 or early 2024.\nNote 22 Segment and Revenue Information\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segments operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We\noperate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See\npage 58 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.\nBCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial\naircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.\nBDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned\nmilitary aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space\nexploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.\nBGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and\ngovernment customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue\non commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other\ncontracts is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.\nBCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our customers.\n109\n"

As \nof December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values were \n$808 million and $402 million, respectively. During 2021, there were approximately $66 million of adjustments due to observable price \nchanges and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges were \napproximately $143 million and $63 million, respectively. \nVerizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of Tracfone, completed in November 2021. The fair value is \ncalculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments include \nvaluation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other \nmarket participants. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair \nvalue with changes recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. \nFixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities are based on the \nquoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from observable market \ndata. The valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2. \nDerivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative \ncontracts and thus are classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our \nderivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis. \nWe recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. \nFair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt \nThe fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical debt instruments, which is a Level 1 \nmeasurement, as well as quoted prices for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities, which is a Level 2 measurement. \nThe fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows: \nFair Value \n(dollars in millions) \nCarrying \nAmount\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal \nAt December 31, 2020\n$ \n127,778 \n$ \n103,967 \n$ \n52,785 \n$ \n $ \n156,752 \nAt December 31, 2021\n149,543 \n106,599 \n62,606 \n \n169,205 \nDerivative Instruments \nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. \nWe employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency \nswaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards.

                    "evidence_text_full_page": "Controlled Substances Litigation, Audits and Subpoenas\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as\ncounties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and third-party payors, alleging claims beginning as far back as the early 2000s generally concerning the impacts of\nwidespread prescription opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\ncourts.\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\nby the Cherokee Nation.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n172\n"

These forward-\nlooking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\noccur.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, us, our or AMD), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the\n4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations.\n40\n"

This is\ndriven by 15% growth in segment net sales in Optical Communications of $674 million and 34% growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $419 million,\nwhich helped offset a $394 million decrease in Display Technologies. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates adversely impacted Cornings consolidated net\nsales by $616 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021.\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of $1,316 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to net\nincome attributable to Corning Incorporated of $1,906 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. When compared to 2021, the $590\nmillion decrease was primarily driven by a $238 million increase in severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges, a $50 million increase\nin litigation, regulatory and other legal matters and a $120 million adverse impact from foreign currency translation.\n \nDiluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.26 per diluted share, or 20%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,\nprimarily driven by the immediate repurchase and retirement of 35 million common shares which resulted in an $803 million one-time reduction to net income available\nto common shareholders in 2021, partially offset by the decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as described above. Refer to Note 16 (Shareholders\nEquity) and Note 17 (Earnings per Common Share) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n \n2023 Corporate Outlook\n \nFor the first quarter 2023, we anticipate core sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion.\n \n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations (in millions):\n \n \n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n% change\n \n \n \n2022\n \n2021\n \n22 vs. 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet sales\n $\n14,189 $\n14,082 \n1%\n \n \n \n \n \nGross margin\n $\n4,506 $\n5,063 \n(11%)\n(gross margin %)\n \n32% \n36% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n $\n1,898 $\n1,827 \n4%\n(as a % of net sales)\n \n13% \n13% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResearch, development and engineering expenses\n $\n1,047 $\n995 \n5%\n(as a % of net sales)\n \n7% \n7% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTranslated earnings contract gain, net\n $\n351 $\n354 \n(1%)\n(as a % of net sales)\n \n2% \n3% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIncome before income taxes\n $\n1,797 $\n2,426 \n(26%)\n(as a % of net sales)\n \n13% \n17% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProvision for income taxes\n $\n(411) $\n(491) \n16%\nEffective tax rate\n \n23% \n20% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n $\n1,316 $\n1,906 \n(31%)\n(as a % of net sales)\n \n9% \n14% \n \n \n \n \n \n \nComprehensive income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n $\n661 $\n1,471 \n(55%)\n \n24\n"

Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n"

Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\nface additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\nreliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\nappropriations bills.\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Companys operations.\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\nCompanys financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n8\n"

We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance.

Further uncertainty with respect to\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\ncontinuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government.

In December 2022, the Board authorized a 10%\nincrease in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.605 per share effective in 2023. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a\npublic company. Future dividends will depend on the Companys earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by\nthe Board.\nSee Note 12 Shareholders Equity included in Item 8 of this 10-K for information regarding CVS Health Corporations dividends.\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of February 1, 2023, there were 24,142 registered holders of the registrants common stock according to the records maintained by the registrants transfer\nagent.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following share repurchase programs have been authorized by the Board:\nIn billions\nAuthorization Date\nAuthorized\nRemaining as of\nDecember 31, 2022\nNovember 17, 2022 (2022 Repurchase Program)\n$\n10.0 \n$\n10.0 \nDecember 9, 2021 (2021 Repurchase Program)\n10.0 \n6.5 \nEach of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of\nopen market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. Both the\n2022 and 2021 Repurchase Programs can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 34.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 billion\npursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Program, including share repurchases under the $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR transaction described below. During the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank).\nUpon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporations common stock\nequal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 17.4 million shares at a price of $92.19 per share, which were placed into\ntreasury stock in January 2023. At the conclusion of the ASR, the Company may receive additional shares representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion\nnotional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Companys stock\nover an averaging period, less a discount. It is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the Company will have an obligation to Citibank\nwhich, at the Companys option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASR, the maximum number of shares that\ncould be delivered to the Company is 43.4 million.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC. Upon\npayment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporations common stock equal to\n80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which were placed into treasury stock\nin January 2022.

This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n55.3 %\n58.5 %\n(3.2)%\n56.4 %\n56.6 %\n(0.2)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n146.6 \n34.7 \n111.9 \n85.0 \n27.9 \n57.1 \nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\n5.7 \n5.5 \n0.2 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n0.3 \nOperating income (loss) margin\n(107.6)%\n1.3 %\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n10.0 %\n(57.2)%\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\n(R&D). The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n"

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, us, our or AMD), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the\n4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations.\n40\n"

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\ncertification and production schedules.\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our\ncommercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023.\nProduction of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023.

We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply\nchain capacity. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to\nreduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n"

The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the\nacquisition.\n The fair value estimates for all three acquisitions were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. Pro forma information related to\nthese acquisitions has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material.\nDisposal of Russian business\n On December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash\nproceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale follows the Companys previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its\nRussian business. The total net cash consideration received, excluding disposed cash and items settled net, was $365 million and resulted in a\npre-tax net gain of $215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022. The impairment charge was based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the\nwide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business has been\nrecorded as restructuring, impairment, and other related activities, net within the consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a\nnet carrying value of $252 million, including allocated goodwill of $46 million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73 million,\nprimarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nYear ended June 30, 2022\n During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the disposal of non-core assets in the Flexibles reporting segment. The\nCompany recorded an expense of $10 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, to adjust the long-lived assets to their fair value less\ncost to sell.\n64\n"

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n"

Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell\ndirectly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles\nand can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their\ncustomers.\nCompetition in Data Center Segment\nIn Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)\nwith our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based\ndesigns are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\nCompetition in Client Segment\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have\ndeveloped ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and\ndevelopment of the ARM ecosystem.\n9\n"

This growth has \nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this \nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is \nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\n \nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll \nexpense.\n \nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. \n \nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention \nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n \nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset \nby an unfavorable SG&A rate. \n \nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and \nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\n \nInternational Segment\n \nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSix Months Ended\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\nRevenue\n$\n 693 \n $\n 760 \n $\n 1,359 \n $\n 1,513 \nRevenue % change\n \n (8.8)% \n (9.3)% \n (10.2)% \n (7.4)%\nComparable sales % change\n \n (5.4)% \n (4.2)% \n (5.5)% \n (2.8)%\nGross profit\n$\n 168 \n $\n 178 \n $\n 326 \n $\n 361 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n \n 24.2 % \n 23.4 % \n 24.0 % \n 23.9 %\nSG&A\n$\n 149 \n $\n 150 \n $\n 287 \n $\n 299 \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n \n 21.5 % \n 19.7 % \n 21.1 % \n 19.8 %\nRestructuring charges\n$\n - \n $\n - \n $\n (1) \n $\n 1 \nOperating income\n$\n 19 \n $\n 28 \n $\n 40 \n $\n 61 \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n \n 2.7 % \n 3.7 % \n 2.9 % \n 4.0 %\n \nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%, \nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. \n \n18\n"

Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n42\n"
