This is the first coal-fired BOT plant using pulverized coal-fired boiler\ntechnology in Vietnam. The BOT company has a PPA with EVN and a Coal Supply Agreement with Vinacomin, both expiring in 2040.\nOn December 31, 2020, AES executed an agreement to sell its entire 51% interest in the Mong Duong 2 plant; however, the transaction\nwas not closed by December 31, 2022 and the agreement was terminated by the parties.\nKey Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, the operating performance and\navailability of the facility.\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Ministry of Industry and Trade in Vietnam is primarily responsible for formulating a\nprogram to restructure the power industry, developing the electricity market, and promulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supply is\nowned by the government through Vinacomin, a state-owned entity, and PetroVietnam.\nThe Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central, and South), with total installed capacity of approximately 79 GW.\nThe fuel mix in Vietnam is composed primarily of coal (33%), hydropower (28%) and renewables, including solar, wind, and biomass (27%).\nEVN, the national utility, owns 39% of installed generation capacity.\nThe government is in the process of realigning EVN-owned companies into three different independent operations in order to create a\ncompetitive power market. The first stage of this realignment was the implementation of the Competitive Electricity Market, which has been in\noperation since 2012. The second stage was the introduction of the Electricity Wholesale Market, which has been in operation since the\nbeginning of 2019. The third and final stage impacts the Electricity Retail Market. The reforms are currently in development and pilot\nimplementation is expected around 2024 timeframe. BOT power plants will not directly participate in the power market; alternatively, a single\nbuyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on their behalf.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nWe estimate the value of stock-based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial-lattice model. Our determination of fair value of stock-\nbased payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly\ncomplex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and\nprojected employee stock option exercise behaviors.\nWe generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights (including restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and performance shares) based on the\nclosing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest\nbased on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. We estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock rights at the\nclosing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified\nperformance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period adjusted for\nestimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant using a\nMonte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting\ntranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates\ninto the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-\nbased restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number\nof shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.\n3.

The yield curve is fitted to yields\ndeveloped from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The present\nvalue of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.\nThe pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and\nanticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,\nthe assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the\nupcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA).\nSince our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan\nassets.

The Utility also operated 35 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 66,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission system is\ninterconnected with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, the Canadian provinces of\nAlberta and British Columbia, and parts of Mexico.\nDecisions about expansions and maintenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility’s regulators and the CAISO.\nElectricity Distribution\nThe Utility’s electric distribution network consists of approximately 108,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which, as of December 31, 2020, approximately\n25% are underground and approximately 75% are overhead), 68 transmission switching substations, and 758 distribution substations, with a capacity of\napproximately 32,000 MVA.

Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary\ndistribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utility\nsells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.

Our vision is to be the world's leading sustainable power\ncompany by leveraging our unique electricity platforms and the knowledge of our people to provide the energy and infrastructure solutions our\ncustomers truly need. Our people share a passion to help meet the world's current and increasing energy needs, while providing communities and\ncountries the opportunity for economic growth due to the availability of reliable, affordable electric power.\nFuture growth across our company will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive wind, solar and gas generation. Growth in\nrenewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation, but also presents significant potential for energy\nstorage. We are a leader in lithium ion, battery-based energy storage, with more than 400 MW in operation, under construction or in advanced\ndevelopment across seven countries. We believe lithium ion-based energy storage will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based\ngeneration mix. With our technological experience, presence in key markets and channel sales partnerships, we are positioned to capitalize on this\nrapidly growing market.\nAdditionally, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure in Central America, where we are helping to displace oil-fired generation in favor\nof a cheaper and cleaner alternative. In the United States, at IPL, we recently completed a multi-year rate-base investment in environmental\nupgrades to our coal plants and are in the process of re-powering several units from coal to gas.\n6",

The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity of its\ntransmission system to secure access to renewable generation resource s and replace aging or obsolete equipment and improve system reliability. The Utility also has\ntaken steps to improve the physical security of its transmission substations and equipment.\nElectricity Distribution\nThe Utility's electricity distribution ne twork consists of a pproximately 142,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground and\napproximately 80% are overhead), 5 9 transmission switching substations, and 606 distribution substations, with a capacity of approxi mately 3 1 , 8 00 MVA. The\nUtility’s distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-\nvoltage transmissio n voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers.\nThese distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary\ndistribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utility\nsells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. In 2016 the Utility commenced operations in a\nnew electric distribution control center facilit y in Concord, California ; along with the existing distribution control centers in Rocklin and Fresno, California, t hese\ncontrol centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilient grid.\nIn 201 6 , the Utility continued to deploy its Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration circuit technology which involves the rapid operation of s mart s\nwitches to reduce the duration of customer outages. Another 8 9 circuits were outfitted with this equipment, bringing the total deployment to 7 89 of the Utility’s\n3,200 distribution circuits.

Vesting for RSUs is contingent upon the holders’ continued\nemployment with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also, certain of our\nperformance-based RSUs, including those that are market-based, include a range of shares that may be released at vesting which are above or below the\ntargeted number of RSUs based on actual performance relative to the performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested RSUs will be\nforfeited. Upon vesting of the RSUs, we may withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements.\nThe following table summarizes our RSU activity with performance-based RSUs, including those with market conditions, presented at 100% of the\ntarget level shares that may potentially vest (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\naverage grant\ndate fair value per\nNumber of shares RSU\nUnvested RSUs at December 31, 2019 7,181 $ 54.23\nGranted 2,254 201.25\nVested (1,513) 49.76\nForfeited (820) 55.39\nUnvested RSUs at December 31, 2020 7,102 $ 82.50\nCertain of our performance-based RSUs did not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2020, as there is not a mutual understanding\nbetween the Company and the employee of the performance terms.

Accordingly, no\ngrant date fair value was established and the weighted average grant date fair values calculated above excludes these RSUs.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately $170 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to RSUs and is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted-average period of 0.75 years.

During 2019, we detected cracks in the \"pickle forks\", a frame fitting component of the structure connecting the wings to the\nfuselages of 737NG aircraft. We notified the FAA, which issued a directive requiring that certain 737NG airplanes be inspected. In 2019, we\nestimated the number of aircraft that would have to be repaired in the future and provisioned for the estimated costs of completing the repairs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we recognized charges of $336 based on revised engineering and fleet utilization estimates as well as updated\nrepair cost estimates. We cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing nature\nof the inspections and repairs and pending the completion of investigations into the cause of the condition.\nCommercial Aircraft Commitments\nIn conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain\ncustomers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in\ncommitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other\nsources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and\nairline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during\nthe period specified in the agreement and require advance notice by the customer.\nTrade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2021 have expiration dates from 2022 through 2028. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, total\ncontractual trade-in commitments were $612 and $950.

The lower benefits in 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year.

Any reference in the Plan to an action by the Vice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such\naction by the Vice President’s delegate or other designated person.\n7.02 Facility of Payment.\nWhenever, in the opinion of the Vice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof\nhereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Vice\nPresident may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment\nbe applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Vice President considers advisable.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nWe estimate the value of stock-based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial-lattice model. Our determination of fair value of stock-\nbased payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly\ncomplex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and\nprojected employee stock option exercise behaviors.\nWe generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights (including restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and performance shares) based on the\nclosing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest\nbased on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. We estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock rights at the\nclosing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified\nperformance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period adjusted for\nestimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant using a\nMonte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting\ntranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates\ninto the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-\nbased restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number\nof shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.\n3.

The decrease in the cash used was primarily due to\ncash used for the King Acquisition in 2016, with no comparable transaction in 2017.

The lower amount of cash used in investing activities in\n2016 was primarily due to a 2015 cash outflow of $3.6 billion for cash placed into escrow to facilitate the King Acquisition.

A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is\nrelated to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing\naircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.\nBCC provided customer financing of $1,376 million and $586 million during 2016 and 2015 . While we may be required to fund a number of new\naircraft deliveries in 2017 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices\nfrom broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if the\nExport-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions.\nAircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built\ncommercial jet aircraft ( 8.8% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2016 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft\ntypes. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 7% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2015 and 2014 , 9.5% and 9.8% of the\nwestern-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with\nrelatively few operators, are placed out of service.\nResults of Operations\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014\nRevenues $298 $413 $416\nEarnings from operations $59 $50 $92\nOperating margins 20% 12% 22%\nRevenues\nBCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and\nnotes, and other income.

BCC ’s revenues in 2015 were consistent with 2014.\nEarnings From Operations\nBCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation\non leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $9 million primarily due to lower asset\nimpairment expense which more than offset lower revenues.

Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net\nperiodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are\nallocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting\ngovernment customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial\nassumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are\nallocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.\nThe Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $882 million in 2021, $1,024 million in 2020\nand $1,071 million in 2019. The lower benefits in 2021 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating\npension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $528 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $374 million in 2019. The higher\nbenefits in 2021 were primarily due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher amortization of\nactuarial losses and higher settlement charges. The benefits in 2020 and 2019 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of\nactuarial losses.\nFor further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 29 of this Form 10-K and\nsee Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per\nshare for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance.

Realization of\nthe U.S. deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable income. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to\nevidence that can be objectively verified.
